(a) Product Updates. Emerging Threats Pro, LLC. shall make available to Subscriber each “Minor” and “Maintenance” functional release of the Rules that Emerging Threats Pro, LLC. makes generally available without additional charge to its maintenance customers and that is intended to replace a prior Rule set version release (“Updates”). Emerging Threats Pro, LLC. shall make available to Subscriber one (1) machine-readable copy of each Update. Updates are designated as follows: (i) a “Major” functional release is indicated by a change in the first digit of a version number (e.g. from 4.0 to 5.0); (ii) a “Minor” functional release is indicated by a change in the second digit (e.g. from 4.0 to 4.1); or (iii) a “Maintenance” release is indicated by a change in the third digit of a version number (e.g. from 5.0.1 to 5.0.2).

Emerging Threats Pro,LLC reserves the right to impose additional charges for Major functional releases of the Rules that provide substantial additional features or perform additional functions not provided or performed by the Rules originally licensed to Subscriber.

(b) Bug Fixes. Emerging Threats Pro, LLC shall exercise commercially reasonable efforts to correct any reproducible malfunction in the Rules reported to Emerging Threats Pro, LLC by Subscriber that prevents the Rules from performing in accordance with the operating specifications (a “Bug”). Subscriber shall be responsible for the installation and testing of any Bug fixes.

Email support requests will be replied to within four (4) hours of receipt. This may not be a full resolution, but an analyst will begin work on and request any further information within this period. Most requests will be resolved within this time period. Requests that are not client specific (i.e. a false positive report for an ET or ET Pro rule, etc) do not require a subscription to contact and work with the Emerging Threats Pro, LLC support department. Support SLAs do not, of course, apply to non-subscribers, although reports will be handled with the same priority and speed.

(d) Phone Support. For site licenses and organizations that require 24/7 phone support availability Emerging Threats Pro, LLC offers a premium support package independent of any licensing volume or pricing requirements.  Support calls will be answered in real time, or should the engineering staff be working with other subscribers by phone, the call will be returned within one (1) hour.

Subscriber acknowledges that all such services provided by Emerging Threats Pro,LLC shall be at Emerging Threats Pro, LLC’s then-current prices, terms and conditions for such services.

In addition to the Maintenance Services provided hereunder, Subscriber may request, and Emerging Threats Pro, LLC will provide technical support services for Subscriber’s use of the Rules as set forth in Subscriber’s purchase agreement (“Maintenance and Technical Support Services”).

	2.	Technical Support Process. Emerging Threats Pro, LLC endeavors to resolve technical issues on the first call or online request for assistance. All of their technical support engineers are highly qualified professionals, and have the responsibility of assessing the nature of the issue and working with the client to resolve the issue independently. Should any issue persist or escalate, the engineer will involve senior engineering management to work with the client until issues are resolved. If at any the Subscriber feels the engineer it is working with may not be able to resolve the issue in a timely manner Subscriber has the right to request to escalate the issue to a senior engineer. In cases where it is established that an issue is not within the control of or purview of the Emerging Threats Pro, LLC Ruleset or staff, or is unrelated and originating elsewhere in a customer’s network or product, the engineers will be happy to continue to work on resolving the issue. However, their time will be charged at the current Emerging Threats Pro, LLC. professional services hourly rate. All charges of this nature will be quoted in writing prior to work continuing, and will require written acceptance from the client.
