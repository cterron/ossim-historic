About Os-sim
------------
Our goal is to obtain a working SIM (Security Infrastructure Monitor) able to
integrate, qualify and correlate both high level and low level security and
network events which is able to compete with commercial products recently
appearing on the security market.
Integrate multiple opensource security/network monitoring products to obtain
three network/host visibility levels:

- Low level log/alert/anomaly information
- Mid level network risk level information
- High level decision support information

Components
----------
- Spade: network anomaly detection
- Snort: pattern matching intrusion detection system
- Acid: log viewer (Event Database)
- OpenNMS: Service availability monitoring
- Mrtg: graphing
- Mysql & PostgreSQL: data storage
- rrdtool: Round robin data storage
- Nessus: vulnerability assesment
- Nmap: Network discovery
- P0f: OS Fingerprinting.
- Arpwatch: Host - Mac.
- More to come....

Development languages
---------------------
- C
- Perl
- PHP
- Java
- Python

Supported platforms
-----------------
- Linux
- Limited functionality on: *BSD, Solaris, MacosX.

Conclusion
----------
Using the above described systems and programming languages our goal is to get
the most information out of every tool with the following objectives in mind:

- Event correlation
- Event qualification
- Network anomaly detection
- Qualified intrusion detection
- Network availability information
